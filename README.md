# LaTeX
Text file to LaTeX file converter

### Usage
Clone or fork this repo, and run the script with the following format:

_python3 LaTeX_Converter.py <file_path> [more_file_paths ...]_

Make sure that you have python installed, either 2.7 or 3.6 should work. Most bugs will have responses through terminal output that should help. If not, please submit an issue on this GitHub page.

Once you have your .tex files, you can import them (or just copy/paste the content if you're not familiar) into a LaTeX compiler. The one I use and recommend is /www.sharelatex.com

#### Contributions
I am a big advocate for OSS in almost every form. I understand that I am not the most experienced snek programmer, nor am I the most well-typeset LaTeX user. If you'd like to make any changes, submit a PR and I'll be happy to merge! This in mind, please make sure that your revised code still works under the examples I've provided in this Repo.
